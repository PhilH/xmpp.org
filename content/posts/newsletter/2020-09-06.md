Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of June 2020.

## Subscribe to the newsletter

We suggest you [Subscribe](https://tinyletter.com/xmpp) to receive the next editions in your inbox as soon as it is published! Promote this newsletter to whoever may be interested.

## Help us to build the newsletter

We started drafting every new issue in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/pulls). 
And we are always happy to welcome contributors. Just join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. 

You have a project and (want to) write about it? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience! Even if you can only spend a few minutes, these would already be helpful.
Tasks which need to be done on a regular basis are for example:
- Aggregation of news in the XMPP universe
- Short formulation of news and events
- Summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEP)
- Review of the draft
- Translations: especially French, German and Spanish

### Newsletter translations
