Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of June 2020.

## Subscribe to the newsletter

We suggest you [Subscribe](https://tinyletter.com/xmpp) to receive the next editions in your inbox as soon as it is published! Promote this newsletter to whoever may be interested.

## Help us to build the newsletter

We started drafting every new issue in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/pulls). 
And we are always happy to welcome contributors. Just join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. 

You have a project and (want to) write about it? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience! Even if you can only spend a few minutes, these would already be helpful.
Tasks which need to be done on a regular basis are for example:
- Aggregation of news in the XMPP universe
- Short formulation of news and events
- Summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEP)
- Review of the draft
- Translations: especially French, German and Spanish

### Newsletter translations

Translations of the XMPP Newsletter will be released here:

- [German](https://www.jabber.de/)
- [French](https://linuxfr.org/tags/xmpp/public)

## Video

:es: Conociendo XMPP - The Comunidad Latina de Tecnologías Libres had an online introduction to XMPP for users back in April 2020 - we would like to reference this even if it is a bit late: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwnzJ9V732E
They also have a user chat with this short and handy MUC ID :) 
comunidadlatinadetecnologiaslibres@chat.disroot.org 

Daniel Gultsch and Holger Weiss had a virtual talk on their A/V implementation in Conversation and describe the technical details. eta finalized the session with a second talk by defining love by this formula: Asteriks + XMPP = <3
